## TITLE

"Visual language DRAKON"

"DRAKON" is an acronym for:

Friendly Russian Algorithmic Language That Provides Visibility/Reliability

## DESCRIPTION

Dragon-editor of Leonid Eisymont's group

The editor dragon was developed under the direction of Leonid Eisymont at the Institute of Applied Mathematics of the Russian Academy of Sciences in the early 90s. Currently not developed and is of historical interest.
